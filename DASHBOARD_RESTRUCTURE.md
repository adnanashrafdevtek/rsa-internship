# Dashboard Restructure Summary

## Overview
Restructured the teacher and student dashboards to have a focused home page showing today's schedule with helpful cards, while moving the full calendar view and classes list to dedicated sidebar pages.

## New Architecture

### Home Pages (Today's Focus)
- **TeacherHome.js** - `/teacher-dashboard`
  - Welcome message with date and A/B day indicator
  - Three quick info cards:
    - Next Class (gradient purple card with time, room)
    - Next Break (gradient pink card with duration)
    - Classes Today (gradient blue card with count)
  - Detailed today's schedule with:
    - Real-time status indicators (Upcoming/In Progress/Completed)
    - Color-coded progress bars
    - Time, room, and grade level info
    - Large time display on the right
    - Active class highlighting with green border

- **StudentHome.js** - `/student-dashboard`
  - Same structure as TeacherHome
  - Includes teacher name in class details
  - View-only access (no edit buttons)

### Schedule Pages (Full Calendar View)
- **TeacherSchedule.js** - `/teacher-schedule`
  - Full React Big Calendar with week/month/day views
  - A/B day headers on calendar
  - Shows all recurring classes
  - Room numbers in event titles

- **StudentSchedule.js** - `/student-schedule`
  - Same calendar view as teacher
  - Shows only enrolled classes
  - View-only interface

### Classes Page (Shared)
- **Classes.js** - `/class`
  - Role-based data fetching:
    - Admin: All classes
    - Teacher: Their classes only (can edit rosters)
    - Student: Enrolled classes only (view-only)
  - Admin can add/edit/delete classes
  - Teacher can edit rosters but not create/delete classes
  - Student can only view class info and rosters

## Sidebar Navigation

### Admin
- Home
- Classes
- Schedule
- Users
- Add User

### Teacher
- 🏠 Home → `/teacher-dashboard`
- 📅 Schedule → `/teacher-schedule`
- 📚 Classes → `/class`
- ⏰ Availability → `/availability`

### Student

## Key Features

### Real-Time Updates
- Current time updates every minute
- Dynamic status badges (Upcoming/In Progress/Completed)
- Countdown timers for upcoming classes
- Break duration calculations

### A/B Day Logic
- Based on start date: August 14, 2024
- Even days since start = A Day (blue)
- Odd days since start = B Day (red)
- Calendar headers show A/B day indicators

### Responsive Design
- Gradient cards with modern shadows
- Clean white backgrounds
- Color-coded status indicators:
  - 🟦 Blue = Upcoming
  - 🟧 Orange = Starting soon (<60 min)
  - 🟩 Green = In progress
  - ⚫ Gray = Completed

### Database Integration
- Teachers: `GET /api/teachers/${id}/schedules`
- Students: `GET /api/students/${id}/classes`
- Classes: Role-based filtering in `/api/classes`
