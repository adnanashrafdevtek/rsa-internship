# Teacher Dashboard Implementation Summary

## Overview
Created a comprehensive teacher dashboard system that allows teachers to:
1. View their personal schedule with all assigned classes
2. See a list of all their classes with detailed information
3. Access and edit class rosters (add/remove students)
4. View classes pulled directly from the database

## Key Features

### 1. Teacher Dashboard (`TeacherDashboard.js`)
- **Two Tab Interface:**
  - **My Schedule Tab**: Week-view calendar showing all classes
  - **My Classes Tab**: Card-based list of all assigned classes

- **Schedule Features:**
  - A/B Day support with color-coded headers
  - Week view only (6:30 AM - 4:00 PM)
  - Displays recurring classes across the week
  - Custom headers showing day names and A/B designation
  - Clean white UI consistent with app design

- **Classes Features:**
  - Grid layout of class cards
  - Each card shows:
    * Subject/Class name
    * Grade level
    * Room number
    * Time schedule
    * Days of week
    * A/B day designation
  - Click on any class card to navigate to roster
  - Hover effects for better UX

### 2. Data Fetching
All data is pulled from the database using these endpoints:

```javascript
// Fetch teacher's classes
GET http://localhost:3000/api/teachers/${teacherId}/schedules

// Returns array of class objects with:
- idcalendar (class ID)
- subject / event_title
- grade
- room_number / room
- start_time
- end_time
- recurring_days (JSON array of day indices: 0=Mon, 1=Tue, etc.)
- ab_day (A/B day designation)
- teacher information
```

### 3. Roster Management
- Teachers can access `/rosters/${classId}` by clicking on class cards
- ClassRosters component already supports teacher role
- Teachers can:
  * ✅ View all students in their classes
  * ✅ Add students to classes
  * ✅ Remove students from classes
  * ❌ Cannot create or delete classes (admin only)

### 4. Routing Updates

**App.js Routes:**
```javascript
// New teacher dashboard route
<Route path="/teacher-dashboard" element={
  <ProtectedRoute>
    <TeacherDashboard />
  </ProtectedRoute>
} />
```

**Home.js Redirect:**
- Teachers are automatically redirected from `/home` to `/teacher-dashboard`
- Ensures teachers land on their personalized interface

**Sidebar Navigation:**
- Teachers see: Dashboard, Availability
- Admins see: Home, Classes, Schedule, Users, Add User
- Students see: Home, Classes, Schedule

### 5. Permissions & Security

**Teacher Permissions:**
- ✅ View own schedule and classes
- ✅ Edit class rosters (add/remove students)
- ✅ Access availability settings
- ❌ Cannot create/delete classes
- ❌ Cannot access admin features
- ❌ Cannot view other teachers' schedules

**Admin Only Features:**
- Create/delete classes
- Manage all schedules
- User management
- System-wide schedule view

### 6. UI/UX Consistency
- Matches the clean white theme throughout the app
- Uses consistent color palette:
  * Primary blue: `#3498db`
  * Dark text: `#2c3e50`
  * Light text: `#7f8c8d`
  * White backgrounds with subtle shadows
- Smooth hover animations
- Responsive design
- Clear visual hierarchy

- `first_name`
- `last_name`
- `email`
- `role` (must be "teacher")

**Classes/Calendar Table:**
- `idcalendar` (primary key)
- `subject` or `event_title`
- `grade`
- `room_number` or `room`
- `start_time` (HH:MM:SS format)
- `end_time` (HH:MM:SS format)
- `recurring_days` (JSON array: [0,1,2,3,4])
- `ab_day` ('A', 'B', or null)
- `teacher_id` (foreign key to users)
- `teacher_first_name`
- `teacher_last_name`

**Class_Students Table:**
- `class_id`
- `student_id`
- Relations for roster management

## Testing Checklist

- [x] Teacher login redirects to dashboard
- [x] Schedule tab shows all classes correctly
- [x] A/B day headers display properly

3. **Database Requirements:**
   - Ensure API endpoint `/api/teachers/${id}/schedules` returns proper data
   - Classes must have `teacher_id` field populated
   - `recurring_days` must be valid JSON array

## Future Enhancements (Optional)
