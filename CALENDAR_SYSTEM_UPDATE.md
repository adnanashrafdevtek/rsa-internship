## 5. A/B Day Display

### **CustomHeader Component**
Used across all calendars to show A/B day information:

```javascript
const CustomHeader = ({ date, label }) => {
  const startDate = moment('2024-08-14');
  const currentDate = moment(date).startOf('day');
  const daysSinceStart = currentDate.diff(startDate, 'days');
  const isADay = daysSinceStart % 2 === 0;
  const abDay = isADay ? 'A' : 'B';

  return (
    <div style={{ textAlign: 'center', padding: '8px 0' }}>
      <div style={{ fontWeight: 'bold', fontSize: '14px', marginBottom: '4px' }}>
        {label}
      </div>
      <div style={{
        padding: '2px 8px',
        borderRadius: '12px',
        backgroundColor: isADay ? '#3498db' : '#e74c3c',
        color: 'white',
        fontSize: '11px',
        fontWeight: 'bold',
        display: 'inline-block',
      }}>
        {abDay} Day
      </div>
    </div>
  );
};
```
